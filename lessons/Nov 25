# implementing databases and tables in Ruby
require 'pg'
db = PG.connect(host: 'localhost', dbname:'atx_data') #in other instances localhost can be a url, or you can only include host name sometimes
result = db.exec("select name, score from inspections where score < 70") #returns restaurants with failing scores
result.entries.count #tells us there are 132 restaurants in results
result.entries.first #returns first result as a hash
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data(...)

can use "system" to do things in Ruby that you might otherewise do in the terminal, e.g.

    def create_db(dbname)
      success = system("createdb #{dbname}")
    end


      #to do multiline strings for sql calls: use <<- or %q and a delimiter

    def creat_tables
      sql = <<-SOMETHING
      multiline 
      string
      multiline
      string
      SOMETHING

        #OR

      sql = %q[
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS classmates(
        first name VARCHAR,
        last_name VARCHAR, 
        twitter_handle VARCHAR,
        age int
        )
      ]

#threequels in ruby works differently than in javascript; it checks if the second object is in the first object, .e.g:

(1..10) === 5 #true
5 === (1..10) #false

# 'case' in ruby uses threequality so it may cause you some problems
SELECT name, zip_code, address, facility_id, INTO restaurants from inspections;  #this will create a new table 'restaurants' from information in 'inspections'

ALTER TABLE inspections DROP COLUMN name, DROP COLUMN address, DROP COLUMN zip_code; #because this is now in restaurants so we don't need it repeated in 'inspections'

SELECT i.score, r.name from inspections i # r and i are just aliases for the tables so we odn't have to type out the whole thing later
JOIN restaurants r  
ON  i.facility_id = r.facility
WHERE score < 70
LIMIT 5; # this whole thing will return 
#the order in which you name tables for 'from' and 'join' doesn't matter, BUT it just has to be the same as the order that you later call in "join"

a join table is used to link data from different tables to each other
reference file "nov 25 table examples" for a visual example of joining tables
