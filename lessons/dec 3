Sinatra Stuff

- bundle init # will create a gemfile already sourced to rubygems
- include gems-- 'sinatra', for one
- bundle install
- create app.rb or server.rb, whatever
- form tag 'placeholder' will put gray text in a form that disappears once you click on it
	<form><input type ='text' placeholder='whatever' /></form>
- sinatra expects a "public" folder in your directory with any kind of public asset such as images and stuff, javascript, css, etc.
	sourcing: <img src='/images.whatev.jpg' -- 'public' is implicit, sinatra will already look there, just include / and any subfolder of 'public'

	get '/people/:id' do
	personid = params[:id]
	end
