GitHub branches

every repo has a 'master' branch. to add an experimental feature you can add a new branch 

'git branch branchname' //adds a new branch, but does not switch to it
'git checkout branchname' //switches to branchname as active branch; if you commit you will be committing to that branch
'git branch' //will list branches in a repo and which one you are currently on
'git merge experiment' //merges named branch into current branch (such as master), but preserves old branch as well

Ruby Development

What is a package manager? apt-get and ruby gems are package managers, they're just libraries of code.
('devise':user authentication gem for rails)
Some gems expect to work in specific environments and may not work on certain systems like Windows.
loading a gem: returns 'true' if successful, returns 'false' if ALREADY LOADED. will raise error otherwise
$LOAD_PATH is a global variable (also $:) which tells the interpreter where the application files etc. are. so you can see where Ruby files on your system are installed, for example.
to test a program in irb with a gem file: 'bundle exec irb' will load the file with the gemfile
Bundler manages gem versions for projects to avoid "dependency hell" when developing in different dev environments. 
Gemfile.lock is created by Bundler and logs which versions of gems were installed
'bundle update GemName'
'bundle install' updates Gems and creates Gemfile.lock

running bundel exec rspec will look for a file ending in "_spec.rb" and run it
