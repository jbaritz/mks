MEAN Stack

MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node

View/Controller/Model structure

Angular is on the frontend and Express is on the backend. Angular has a "scope variable" which makes things usable in controllers. View -> Controller -> scope -> Controller -> Model/backend -> MongoDB

Express is similar to sinatra, node can be compared to Ruby. Javascript is used in Node. Node is a runtime, like how browsers have javascript runtimes that let them use it. Node makes a lot of small requests very efficiently.
