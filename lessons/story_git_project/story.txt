"If I was a leaf, I would fly clear across the world," Tommy thought andd then ran out into the yeard among the swirl of colors.

"I don't want that," Tommy said.

"if you are blown in that direction, you will fly high into the air and see tings that no leaf has seen before."

"Follow me to the city dump," the maple leaf said. "Most of my friends are there."
