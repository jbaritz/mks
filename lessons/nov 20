0 in Javascript is falsey because JAVASCRIPT IS JANK ASS SHIT

when making a post request through jQuery you usually have to instantiate the server

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer

	an html form must have an "action" with a target url endpoint to submit to
	e.preventDefault on submit stops the form from submitting so the page doesn't refresh

	using "context": $('p', '.one') will select p tags within class "one", which is the "context" of 'p'
	same as: $('.two p') and $('.two').find('p')

	bracket html attributes in jquery: "$('[name=reviewer]'')"
	$('.one') is same as $('[class=one]'')

	html elements can only have one id, but many classes. 

	"name = " is only for inputs

	use id's sparingly

	.val() gives whatever user typed in

	.html('<tag>stuff</tag>') replaces whatever you selected with the html in the ()s
