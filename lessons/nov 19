javascript has a .forEach method which is basically a for loop to iterate through an array

	a = [10, 20, 30, 40]
	a.map(function(x) {
	return x * 10;
	})
	// returns [100, 200, 300, 400]

	a.filter(function(x){
	return x > 30
	})
	// returns [40]

short-circuiting: undefined is a falsey value, so:
	var counts = {x: 5}
	if (counts['x']) {alert("truthy")}
	// will trigger alert, values are truthy in JS just like Ruby

	true || false || false || false || false
	// will eval to true, once JS sees one "true" it doesn't check the rest in an || call


jQuery
	select all p with class "large":
		$('p.large')

subbing in Ruby
	"AT-field".sub('-','') #this will remove the - from the string entirely

Ruby reduce method is the same as inject, every other language calls it reduce as well:
	array = [10, 30, 40, 60]
	array.reduce(0) do |r, e| //r is equal to starting value r, e iterates through array
		r + e 				  // adds 0+10, then 10+30, then 40+40, then 80+60
	end

	movies.reduce(Hash.new(0)) do |hist, movie|
		hist[movie['genre']] += 1
		hist
	  end

sort_by does convert a hash into an array of arraysl so be mindful of that

	a=(1..20).to_a
	a.reduce(:+) // uses + as block and applies to all elements, so this adds up all elements of a
