REPL - "Read evalaute print loop," irb is the ruby one

rbenv is a better version of rvm, installs gems in directory of project and manages your ruby versions easier

bundler - gem tool that gets and installs gems

gems are libraries of code that someone else as written so you don't have to reinvent the wheel - rubygems.org

don't use "hard" tabs when writing ruby files-- just use spaces (can set in sublimetext preferences - settings-more - syntax specific)

\ is an "escape character" for strings-- so if you have a string "and then she was like "omg!"" with a nested quotation mark you'd put "and then she was like \"omg!\""

in order to read a file in Ruby without having to read the whole thing, you can "open a stream". but if you open it explicitly you must also close it, or pass a block, which opens and closes it
		
		variable = File.read('filename.ext') #but this will read the whole file
		variable = File.open('filename.ext') #opens without reading but keeps it open
		variable.close 
		variables._each_line {|x| puts x} #prints out file, much less memory space

\n in a file readout indicates "enter" or a "return"

search a string: "string".match(/X/) #searches for "X" in string, returns a match data object
				matchfound = "string".match(/s/)
				if matchfound
					puts "i found an s" #this will run
				end 

blah = "6 oz mixed greens"
blah.to_i #will return 6!
"6 oz whatever".to_i #returns 6
"whatever".to_i #returns 0
