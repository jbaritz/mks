Big O notation
O(n)
O(1) #just doing one thing, regardless of how many elements you have
O(n^2)
O(logn) #n is the number of elements you're working with

"cycle" sort of generates an infinite list, but only if you ask for it

e.g. 

	['hi'].cycle.take(10) #will print 'hi' ten times

Hash[ [[1, 'one'],[2, 'two']] ] #this will yield:
  {1 => 'one', 2 => 'two'}

Hash[[10,20,30].zip [1].cycle] #yields:
{10 => 1, 20 => 1, 30 => 1}

More Database Stuff

You can technically use arrays as column values but you shouldnt. 

Using join tables with HTML!

<select name="genre_ids[]"> #the brackets lets sinatra know there may be multiple values inputted

Songify::AlbumRepo.save(db, {
  :title => "album"
  :genre_ids => [11, 22]

})
#create album, then iterate through genre_ids and create album genre join row for each genre genre_ids
